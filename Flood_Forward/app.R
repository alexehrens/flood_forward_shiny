Flood Managed Aquifer Recharge (Flood-MAR) is an integrated water resource management strategy that utilizes floodwaters, from or in anticipation of, precipitation events for managed aquifer recharge. Flood-MAR provides an opportunity to simultaneously reduce flood risk during storm events and recharge underlying aquifers to increase the stateâ€™s drought-resilient water supply, while enhancing natural ecosystems.",

Climate change is projected to cause highly variable weather that will make old water management strategies obsolete. New management strategies are required to adapt to intensified flood risk events.  Droughts and more extreme precipitation events are projected to occur. Additionally, precipitation is expected to fall more as rain instead of snow, reducing the reliance on the Sierra snowpack as a reliable source of freshwater storage. 
                        
                        Another motivation for this project is to advocate for the sustainable management of groundwater. Groundwater accounts for 43% of the average water supply in California during normal years. In years of drought, Central Valley farmers and residents rely on groundwater for as much as 70% of water supply. Extreme drought coupled with the demand for irrigating crops has led to the unsustainable extraction of groundwater causing aquifers to deteriorate."),

Groundwater is an essential source of water for agricultural, domestic, municipal, industrial, and environmental sectors of Madera County, which has a population of over 156,000 people. The largest economic sector in Madera is agriculture, which utilizes 500,000 acre feet of groundwater each year, providing commodities to the nation and generating at least $2 billion annually for the county. Madera is vulnerable to flood risk. There were 6-7 major flooding events from 1978 - 2009.  Climate change is likely to increase this number of flooding disasters in Madera, as precipitation will fall more as rain, and in more intense bursts. Additionally, Madera has lost over 90% of its floodplain habitat. Restoring this critical resource will help reduce flood risk throughout the county. Madera Basin is identified as critically overdrafted. To comply with SGMA, groundwater sustainability agencies (GSAs) in the Basin were required to develop a groundwater sustainability plan (GSP)."),
